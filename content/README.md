# `content/` — the game as data

Rules, items, campaigns, and chapters are JSON, not code. Adding content never requires a deploy of
game code (roadmap, "Content as data"). Everything here is validated in CI by
`npm run content:validate`, because **a malformed chapter must fail the build, never the play
session** ([architecture §5](../docs/architecture.md#5-chapter-schema)).

```
content/
  rules.json                     species, classes, stats, levels, tiers   → RulesContent
  items.json                     the item catalog, keyed by itemId        → ItemCatalog
  campaigns/<id>.json            a story arc, listing its chapters        → Campaign
  chapters/<id>.json             one ~30-minute sitting                   → Chapter
schemas/
  rules|items|chapter|campaign.schema.json     JSON Schema, draft 2020-12
```

The TypeScript types in `packages/shared/src/types/` are the contract. The schemas are kept in
lockstep with them; **where the two disagree, the TS types win** and the schema is the thing that
needs fixing.

## The Bramblewood chapter is reference content

`campaigns/the-hollow-crown.json` and `chapters/bramblewood-01.json` are **the engine's reference
content, not the authored campaign.** Allen hand-writes the first real chapter himself, deliberately,
to learn what the format needs ([roadmap Chapter 3](../docs/roadmap.md#chapter-3--first-playable-)).
This one exists so that the loader, the schema validator, the scene renderer, and the dice have
something valid and complete to run against before that happens.

It is deliberately a superset of what one chapter normally uses: every non-combat scene type
(`story`, `check`, `choice_point`, `rest`), one `encounter`, species-gated choices for all six
species, a flag gate, an item gate, item grants, a quest item, a branch that reconverges, and — the
one that matters — **a failed roll that keeps the story going.** If a renderer handles this chapter,
it handles anything.

## Conventions the schema cannot state

- **Icons are short slugs** (`fist`, `wing`, `eye`, `spark`, `hand`, `flame`, `key`, …), never file
  paths. The client resolves a slug to an inline SVG, so every element gets an icon (spec §11).
  Note that the worked example in architecture §5 shows item icons as `icons/items/*.svg` paths;
  we use one slug namespace for rules, choices, and items alike so there is exactly one icon
  lookup in the client.
- **A scene with an empty `choices` array ends the chapter.** The `Chapter` type has no terminal
  marker, and this is the only representable one. `rest_lanternfall` is that scene here, which
  matches spec §6.1 — Rest *is* the end-of-session beat. Every chapter needs at least one, and every
  other scene must lead somewhere; the validator enforces both.
- **`items.json` carries no `$comment` key.** It is a bare `Record<itemId, ItemDef>` and anything at
  the top level is treated as an item. Comments for it live here.
- **Trinkets stay small on purpose.** +1 to a stat, +1 step, +2 max HP, one reroll per encounter —
  and nothing bigger, ever. The level-up transformation is the reward the game is built around and
  no item may compete with it (spec §9.3).
- **XP is a chapter award.** `xpAward` is the payout; the single `grantXp` in the reference chapter
  is a small exploration bonus, kept small so that exploring and talking stay worth about as much as
  fighting (spec §8.1).
