Kids & Dragons - clean drafted coat masks (docs/hero-looks.md section 4.3, step 2).

`npm run art:coat-draft` picks a hero's two parts out by colour, which bleeds wherever two parts
share one (a Bigfoot's shaded fur is as warm as his skin; a unicorn's hooves are as purple as her
mane). This is the hand cleaning, written down so it can be run again: per-species rules, then a
per-painting table of hand fixes for what no rule separates (an artist's brush and eraser).

    R  the main part   unicorn: her coat          bigfoot: his fur (cream body and brown mane)
    G  the accent part unicorn: mane, forelock, tail  bigfoot: his skin (face, hands, feet)
    B  the figure      the draft's, as drafted (the painting's alpha)

Never in R or G: eyes, dark outlines, horn, hooves, Bigfoot's green leaves. Both parts get a
soft edge (a ~1px blur), clipped to the figure, and are shared out where the blurs meet so a
pixel is never more than wholly coloured.

Usage:
    npm run art:coat-draft -- bigfoot --family base --out staging/coat-drafts
    npm run art:coat-clean -- bigfoot                 # base family, drafts from staging/coat-drafts
    npm run art:coat-clean -- bigfoot --tier mythic
    npm run art:coat-clean -- bigfoot --drafts DIR --out DIR2   # read DIR/assets/..., write DIR2/assets/...

It writes beside each painting in assets/ unless --out is given. Then review the result on
`npm run art:sheet -- --coat` and list the painting in assets/manifest.json -> coatMasks.paintings.

Only the base family has rules yet (unicorn and Bigfoot); the class and gear waves (#668) add
theirs to RULES and FIXES.
