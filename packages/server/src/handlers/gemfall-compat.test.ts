/**
 * Gemfall, after the nonlinear-campaign epic (#191) — the integration gate's
 * regression (#203): "Gemfall still plays identically with legacy saves."
 *
 * Every issue of the epic pinned its own corner (ordered-campaigns.test.ts:
 * no journey on an ordered row or run or view, CHOOSE_EXIT and RIFT_ACTION
 * refused, Gemfall's fight numbers hashed against a pre-buff digest, no
 * environment in any shipped encounter). This file is the whole-campaign
 * answer, and it compares against the build *before* the epic rather than
 * against itself:
 *
 *   1. The files. Gemfall's sixteen chapters and its campaign file hash to the
 *      digests they had before the epic (its content has not changed since
 *      57c63ba8), load through the real loader, and are sound chapters.
 *   2. Every ending. Each of the 48 terminal scenes across the sixteen
 *      chapters is reached from its chapter's entry, and settled through the
 *      server from an attempt standing at the beat before: what the attempt
 *      row says afterwards is digested and compared with the digest the same
 *      probe produced on the pre-epic build.
 *   3. The roads. All three roads and all three pursuits, carried across
 *      eight evenings in new rooms by the attempt's `routeFlags` — the chapters
 *      CONTINUE picked and the rows it left, against the pre-epic digest.
 *   4. Setbacks. The setback limit fails the attempt; the next evening starts
 *      Gemfall again. Against the pre-epic digest.
 *   5. Saves. A row in the shape written before attempt ids existed carries
 *      on; a run saved mid-fight by the pre-epic build resumes and plays out
 *      exactly as that build played it; the repositories hand legacy rows
 *      back unchanged and write them back without a journey; the graph
 *      intents refuse a legacy row and write nothing.
 *
 * The probe that plays 2-4 (and that produced the pre-epic save) is
 * gemfall-compat-probe.ts, written against nothing the epic added so it runs
 * on both builds. To re-take the goldens after a *deliberate* Gemfall change:
 * run the probe on the old and new builds as described there, and say why in
 * the commit.

/**
 * SHA-256 of each Gemfall file (line endings normalized), as shipped before
 * the epic and unchanged since. The epic's rule is that Gemfall is never
 * edited; a change here is a Gemfall content change and needs its own issue.
 *
 * Re-pinned deliberately for the chapters' `priority` marks (the priority-scene
 * sweep): presentation only — the endings, roads, setbacks and saves below
 * still match their pre-epic digests.
 *
 * Re-pinned for gemfall-07h's Warden Clerk: its five checkpoint scenes cast the
 * one clerk as the single Skywarden faun figure, not the three-warden group
 * the stage now stands for `entities/skywardens`. Presentation only, like the
 * priority marks.
 *
 * Re-pinned for the `voiceGuide` rename (#347): each chapter's authors' voice
 * guide changed its key name and nothing else, and nothing at play time reads
 * it. The endings, roads, setbacks and saves below still match their pre-epic
 * digests.
 *
 * Re-pinned for the chapter 7 cohesion rewrite (#355): wording, labels and
 * check prompts only in 06, 07h, 07l and 07r (the opening states the goal and
 * the test, the masks are named where they first appear and seeded on 06's
 * spine). No scene, edge, flag, effect, stat or TN moved; the endings, roads,
 * setbacks and saves below still match their pre-epic digests.
 *
 * Re-pinned for gemfall-07l's `checkKind` marks (#354): four heart checks
 * whose prompts #355 made physical say `"doing"` for the pacing report.
 * Nothing at play time reads the field; the digests below are unchanged.
 *
 * Re-pinned for the chapter goals (#356): each chapter gained a `goal` and the
 * chapter-local `setFlag`s its steps watch. Those flags are no route set's, so
 * they die with the chapter, and none is set where the pinned mid-fight save
 * resumes (02's wolves to its plank bridge). The endings, roads, setbacks and
 * saves below still match their pre-epic digests.
 *
 * Re-pinned for "Last time..." (#357): the campaign file gained `lastTime`, one
 * line per route-set member and an opener, read by the shared screen before a
 * chapter's first scene. The engine and server never read it, and no chapter
 * file changed. The endings, roads, setbacks and saves below still match their
 * pre-epic digests.
